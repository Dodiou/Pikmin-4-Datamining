// NOTE: ActorSpawner is used in Objects as well, but only for mounds. no important info (except maybe larva spawn interval)

// comp.Properties.ActorSpawner
// ActorSpawner.Properties?.ActorSpawnAIParameter?.DropSpawnMiniInfo?.DropActor && CustomParameter='ShoulderBomb' (dweevil w bomb)
// Only CustomParameter of note is ShoulderBomb.
//   Others are Bomb (probably a mistake, only two mounds use it) and SVSleep000/LFSleep005/SV024 (survivors)
