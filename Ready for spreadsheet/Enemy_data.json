    "Olimar Desc.": "Pikmin supposedly evolved from plants,\r\nyet there are also Pikmin species with\r\nbodies made of ice, known as Ice\r\nPikmin. How is this possible?\r\n\r\nThe answer to this question lies in the\r\nfact that Ice Pikmin are parasitic by\r\nnature, and the ice serves as their\r\nhost. The composition of this type of\r\nice is, predictably, mostly water, but it\r\nresembles saline solution with faint\r\nconcentrations of trace sodium ions,\r\npotassium ions, and calcium ions that\r\nfunction as neural transmitters.\r\n\r\nInterestingly, the ice exhibits no visual\r\nsigns of melting or dripping when\r\nexposed to sunlight. This is due to\r\nits low-temperature core, which\r\ncontinuously creates more ice in\r\norder to maintain a consistent size."

They also share special\r\ncharacteristics, such as the leaf atop\r\ntheir head. Yet they do not spawn from\r\nan Onion but a Lumiknoll, and they are\r\nonly active at night or underground.\r\nDuring the day, they revert into seeds\r\nand enter a resting state.\r\n\r\nWhat's even more surprising is that\r\nthey exhibit no signs of life. When a\r\nGlow Pikmin \"dies,\" if that word can\r\neven be used, it does not expire in\r\nthe typical sense. Instead, it just\r\nbecomes a form of light\u00e2\u20ac\u201dor perhaps\r\na photon\u00e2\u20ac\u201dand returns to the Lumiknoll.\r\n\r\nPutting aside my \"scientist\" hat for\r\na moment...it seems to me that this\r\ncreature or entity may not be a living\r\norganism at all but some manner\r\nof spiritual substance."

However, when one breaks\r\ndown the biological matter it has\r\nabsorbed, a fuel similar to bioethanol\r\nis created.
