This\r\nfact would lead one to believe that\r\ntheir neural-transmission methods\r\nare quite different than our own.\r\n\r\nThis species often uses the ear-like\r\nlamellae on its head to soar to great\r\nheights and dig holes.",
    "PIKMINBLUE": "[UE:Meta key=\"77d97244a80d4c68914e013633adfdfc\" Scale=\"1\"/]The accepted theory is that Pikmin\r\nevolved from terrestrial root\r\nvegetables, and so would be unable to\r\nbreathe underwater and subsequently\r\ndrown. Yet the Blue Pikmin possess\r\na gill resembling a mouth on their head,\r\nwhich enables them to be active\r\nunderwater. While on land, they leaf\r\nand flower like other Pikmin species,\r\nand they breathe through the stomata\r\non their skin, indicating they must be\r\nnaturally amphibious.\r\n\r\nPigment proteins on the surface of\r\ntheir body essentially perform the\r\nsame photosynthetic process as\r\ncyanobacteria, for example, which is\r\nwhat gives them their striking color.",

It's astonishing.\r\n\r\nThe density of their muscle fibers is\r\nalso much higher than that of other\r\nPikmin, allowing them to transport\r\n10 times as much weight as their\r\naverage-sized counterparts. Their rich\r\npurple color is derived from strong\r\npolyphenol antioxidants.\r\n\r\nLike White Pikmin, they are born from\r\nunderground Candypop Buds, and no\r\nrelated Onions have been discovered\r\nso far.

How is this possible?\r\n\r\nThe answer to this question lies in the\r\nfact that Ice Pikmin are parasitic by\r\nnature, and the ice serves as their\r\nhost. The composition of this type of\r\nice is, predictably, mostly water, but it\r\nresembles saline solution with faint\r\nconcentrations of trace sodium ions,\r\npotassium ions, and calcium ions that\r\nfunction as neural transmitters.\r\n\r\nInterestingly, the ice exhibits no visual\r\nsigns of melting or dripping when\r\nexposed to sunlight.

When a\r\nGlow Pikmin \"dies,\" if that word can\r\neven be used, it does not expire in\r\nthe typical sense.

However, when one breaks\r\ndown the biological matter it has\r\nabsorbed, a fuel similar to bioethanol\r\nis created.
